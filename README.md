# Maplestory2_Enhancement_Analysis

Essentially if you want to get the fastest possible upgrade (least number of weapons and have a lot of money to spare, don't use any extra weapons and you will on average be very close to maximum enhancement stacks by +14 which then makes it much easier to get to +15.

If you have time and can risk getting weapons slowly, the best method of upgrading is by maxing the number of extra weapons and at +14, just use them all over and over again (as saving enchantment charges is very unlikely to hold any effect).

The notebook can be downloaded and ran with different meso costs and altered to return specific important values (such as total number of onyx from 11->15) but the point of this analysis was to find out the cost/return on enchantment charges and if it is worth saving or not.
